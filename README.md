# Pre 1.9 features 
	
  - **Not Viking-Friendly** : Divides by 2 the damages dealt by axes.
  - **Good old days regenration** : Slows down regeneration, equals 1 half-heart/ 4 seconds. /!\ Modify the /gamerule naturalRegeneration.
  - **Good old days fishing_rod**  : Adds back damages and knockback to fishing_rods.
  - **Shields're for cowards**  : Forbids shield crafting and transforms shields into iron_ingots if obtained any other way (villagers, dungeons,...).

# Fun features 
	
  - **Master Kenobi's style**  : Allows to send back arrows with diamond_sword. Arrows sent back deal half the damage of the one initialy shot.
  - **PiouPiou BoumBoum**  : Make fireworks create an explosion when they hit an Entity. Explosion size depends on the flight_duration of the firework. Flight duration 3 has the same explosive power as flight duration 2 but adds fire to the explosion.
  - **Why walk when you can dance**  : Allow (when not in creative) to double jump. Also allows to dash by performing a right clik with a sword, 8s cooldown between 2 dashes. If you dash on someone it deals damages. Fall damages are disabled.
  - **Dark Magic** - Adds random potion effects with unbreaking to melee weapons, depending on the level of unbreaking. Can't be combined with Fire_aspect.
